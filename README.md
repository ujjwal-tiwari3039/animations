# 🚀 Website Opening Animations

A collection of high-performance HTML/CSS animations designed for website entry transitions. These animations are built to be lightweight, modern, and easily integrated into any web project.

## 📁 Project Structure

## 🔮 Future Updates & Roadmap
I plan to expand this repository with more complex effects as I progress through my B.Tech studies and IoT training:
- [ ] **JavaScript Triggers:** Adding scroll-based reveal animations.
- [ ] **SVG Animations:** Integrating vector-based morphing effects.
- [ ] **IoT Integration:** Exploring ways to trigger web animations via hardware sensors (ESP8266/NodeMCU).
- [ ] **Dark Mode Support:** Auto-switching themes based on system preferences.
